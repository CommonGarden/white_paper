\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

% Nick suggested: I would prefer to see a (brief) overview of what's presented in this paper, then a description of the problem.

Smart environments can be formalized as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), that are
systems that integrate computations with physical processes~\cite{alur2015principles, lee2016introduction}. In our case, computations concern streams of data coming from
sensors and actuators interacting with biological, hence physical, processes.
In general, embedded computers monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The design of such systems, therefore, requires understanding the joint dynamics of computers, software, networks, as well as biological and physical processes~\cite{derler2012modeling}.

We present a framework for creating such systems in the context of Agricultural and Biological research and production.
