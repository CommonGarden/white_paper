\section{Smart environments on the blockchain}

If we're really going to have apps that can diagnose disease in organisms of importance to us, just by taking a snapshot of the organism, we're going to need lots of data. To incentivize the creation of such data, we propose integration with the following decentralized technologies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item DAT
    \item IPFS
    \item EVM
    % \item FOAM
\end{itemize}

In addition to these there are numerous supply chain related blockchain projects that could be potentially integrated with.

\subsection{Decentralized storage and streaming of datasets}
DAT and IPFS

Dat is a protocol designed for syncing folders of data even if the are large and constantly changing. The data from a growing environment may be collected at the cloud level or on local networks of devices.

\subsection{Selling event data streams on the EVM}
A single stream temperature data may not be interesting on it's own, but in context of an environment it can be an extremely vital piece of information.
