\section{Use Cases}

Smart Environments have application in many fields.

% \subsection{A / B testing growing environments}





% Smart environments can be used in agricultural research (both indoors and outdoors).

% New product trials
% Plant breeding
% Phenotypic experiments

% \subsection{Medical Research}
% Much of medical research is conducted on lab animals such as mice or zebra fish. Environmental variables greatly affect the reproducibility of scientific results.

% Animals can be effected by environmental variables such as lighting, background noise, human interaction, temperature, and more. \cite{}

% Smart environments can lend greatly to providing for reproducible research with regards to animal experimentation.

% \subsection{Cellular Agriculture}
% % Smart environments for multiplexing experiments

% * Media optimization

% \subsection{Industrial Automation}


% \subsection{Synthetic Biology}
% Chemical reagents such as CRISPR CAS 9 are subject to environmental variables such as temperature and humidity.
